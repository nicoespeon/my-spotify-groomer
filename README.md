# My Spotify Groomer

## Getting started

This project is made using:

  * [Phoenix](http://www.phoenixframework.org/) v1.2.1, the [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/) web framework, for the back-end
  * [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/) v0.18 for the front-end

You first need to install Elixir: http://elixir-lang.org/install.html.

You don't have to install Elm as it is installed locally.

### Start the app

To start the app:

  * Install dependencies with `npm install` - it will install Elixir deps too
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `npm start`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

## Commands

  * `npm start` to start the phoenix server
  * `npm test` to run back & front tests
  * `npm run test:back` to run back-end tests
  * `npm run test:back:watch` to run back-end tests in watch mode
  * `npm run test:front` to run front-end tests
  * `npm run test:front:watch` to run front-end tests in watch mode
  * `npm run deploy` to create a production-ready build
